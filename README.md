# Countdown Clock
A countdown clock made in python that i slightly edited from the internet. If you need to run this from a terminal, run `cd <directory_name>` where <directory_name> is the directory you have stored the file in. Then if you have python 3, run `python3 countdownclock.py` to run the program. Enjoy!
